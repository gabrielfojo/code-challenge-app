<h1>Code challenge - Docker</h1>

<h3>App URL</h3>
<p>docker-compose up<p>
<a href="http://0.0.0.0:8080/">http://0.0.0.0:8080/</a>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
This is a code challenge made a time ago, the challenge required a backend, in any language, and a frontend. The frontend should not use a JS framework. The app should be delivered in a docker-compose stack.
</p>
<p>
The same app was recreated in Vue.JS later.
